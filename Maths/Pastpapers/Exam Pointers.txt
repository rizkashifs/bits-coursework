Here are a few pointers for the ending comprehensive examinations. 

1. The paper would have 10 to 15 marks from the midsem portions and rest would be from post midsem. 

2. Questions would be concept based and not computationally intensive. 

3. Go through the concepts on gradient descent, pca, non-linear optimisation including primal and dual, and svm for the post midsem portions.
